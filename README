This is dictionary generating code for cuneiform.

The main parts of the dictionary are the following:
header
tree
endings list

writeheader.c generates header
speltree.hs   generates tree
endings.hs    generates endings list

Each of these three file can be compiled in a default way (gcc -o writeheader, ghc )

Steps to produce dictionary:
1) prepare table of word stems in the format:
<stem> <frequency> <index in ending table>
2) prepare table of word endings (each line should contain a list of the separate nest for endings).
3) run "speltree" on stem table. Collect tree length from the output
4) run "endings" on the endings table. Note the length of the components reported by this program.
5) run "writeheader" feeding it table length from speltree and the three lengthes of the ending sections from the output of endings
6) concatenate output files


endings usage: cat endingfile | endings <outputfile1>
speltree usage: cat stemfile | speltree <outputfile1>
